      "content='<think>\\nOkay, the user is asking, \"What is the capital of France?\" Hmm, this seems like a straightforward question. Let me start by recalling basic geography. France is a country in Western Europe. I remember that major cities in France include Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and others. Now, capitals are usually the largest or most politically significant city. Paris rings a bell as the capital. Let me verify that.\\n\\nI think Paris is indeed the capital of France. It\\'s where the government is based, and it\\'s the most well-known city associated with France. But wait, could there be any confusion? I know that some countries have different cities for their capitals versus their largest cities. For example, in the UK, London is both the capital and the largest city. In France, Paris is both the capital and the largest city. \\n\\nLet me double-check to make sure I\\'m not mixing up any details. I recall that Paris is located in the northern part of France, along the Seine River. It\\'s a major cultural and economic hub. The French government, including the president and the parliament, is based in Paris. The Eiffel Tower and the Louvre are iconic landmarks there. \\n\\nIs there any possibility that the capital is a different city? I don\\'t think so. Sometimes, countries have administrative capitals in addition to their political ones, but France doesn\\'t have that. The capital is clearly Paris. Maybe the user is testing basic geography knowledge, or perhaps they\\'re preparing for a quiz. Either way, the answer is straightforward. \\n\\nI should also consider if there\\'s any historical context. Has the capital ever changed? I know that historically, different cities have served as capitals in various countries. For example, in the UK, London became the capital in the 11th century, but before that, it was other cities. However, for France, Paris has been the capital for centuries. During the French Revolution, the government moved from Versailles to Paris, which solidified its role as the capital. \\n\\nSo, after all that, I\\'m confident the answer is Paris. No need to overcomplicate it. The user probably just wants a direct answer. Let me make sure there are no typos or mistakes in the response. Yep, everything checks out. The capital of France is Paris.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of France is Paris. It is located in the northern part of the country along the Seine River and serves as the political, economic, and cultural center of France. Notable landmarks include the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral. Paris has been the capital since the early Middle Ages and remains one of the world\\'s most iconic cities.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 553, 'prompt_tokens': 15, 'total_tokens': 568, 'completion_time': 1.245786192, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.000418064, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.158091866, 'total_time': 1.246204256}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_2bfcc54d36', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'} id='lc_run--019c581a-fd96-7442-bfe8-a1c22ca09588-0' tool_calls=[] invalid_tool_calls=[] usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 15, 'output_tokens': 553, 'total_tokens': 568}\n"
